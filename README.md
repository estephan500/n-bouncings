# n-bouncings
How python can make n number of bouncings

This application uses pygame and some simple graphics to show how objects can handle an array of complex things. 

SCREEENHEIGHT and SCREENWIDTH may need adjusting.

What does this program make?  It makes a bunch of dynaboxes. What is a dynabox? It's a rectangle of random size that bounces around the screen in the simple manner of a Pong ball. But inside each dynabox, what is inside? A ball that bounces around the rectangle in the simple manner of a Pong ball OR a classic gravity bouncing ball.

Someday, something will bounce within that...
